# Isola---Adversarial-Search
This project implements the game Isolation with a GUI and AI agents. Players (human or computer) move pawns and remove tiles to trap the opponent. Two heuristics, Jerry and Casey, guide AI decisions using minimax with alphaâ€“beta pruning. Experiments compare strategies by tracking wins and average moves.
